# TS100
Source code for the TS100 Soldering Iron

## UNTESTED!

This repository is my attempt (so far) at converting the source code for the TS100 soldering iron to the free System Workbench IDE and gcc based compilers.

I am also attempting to translate / comment as a go for a reference.

Untested on actual hardware until noted otherwise.
